# Language-Classifier
This project utilizes basic machine learning with python to classify languages. The algorithm has been trained in 15 different languages and is able to correctly make a prediction as to what language the user is typing in. Due to overlaps in vocabulary for similar languages, the algorithm may some mistakes, but for the vast majority of test cases, the algorithm has been exceptionally accurate. The graphical user interface was made with pygame. Users can type onto their screen and once they submit their message, the ML algorithm will run and the screen will update with the result.
